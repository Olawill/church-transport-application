Can we add ability for platform admin to be able to make an organization free for life giving them access to enterprise level tier. It could either be for a fee or for nothing

The platform should also have super user and user roles with different levels of permission and privileges.

Can we also add that each organization can add their own secrets for (google map api key, google clientid and secret for oauth, facebook secret and clientid for oauth, whatsapp secrets and any other organization specific secrets). Each organization should be onboarded properly

Organization should be able to use whether they want to show email/password or facebook or google auth or phone auth on their login page or all or a combination of all.

Can we also add phone login, where users are able to login with entering their phone number, and get otp either by whatsapp or sms.

Can we also show a modern pricing page on the platform, where users can get started as well

Organizations should only started from the platform where they can register and signup, before getting access to their tenant page

After signing up, each organization should have its own domain, so like org1.churchtranspo.com, where users can then sign up to use their transportation service
